# ProSeed for Farming Simulator 19
![For Farming Simulator 19](https://img.shields.io/badge/Farming%20Simulator-19-FF7C00.svg) [![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/stijnwop/proSeed.svg)](https://github.com/stijnwop/proSeed/releases)

ProSeed adds a bundle of functionality to enhance sowing machines in the game.
With ProSeed you're able to create tramlines (with optional pre-emergence marking), halfside shutoff for creating the perfect tramlines, fertilizer shutoff and active feedback with sounds.

## Publishing
Only Wopster is allowed to publish any of this code as a mod to any mod site, or file sharing site. The code is open for your own use, but give credit where due. I will not accept support for any 'version' of the ProSeed that is obtained from a sketchy mod page. Versioning is controlled by me and not by any other page. This confuses people and really holds back the development which results in no fun for me!

## Warning!
Please be aware that this is a ***DEVELOPMENT VERSION***!
* The development version can break the game or your savegame!
* The development version can break the game or your savegame!
* The development version doesnÂ´t support the full feature package yet!

#### Multiplayer
This version should also work in Multiplayer.
